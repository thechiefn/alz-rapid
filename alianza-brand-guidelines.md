## Brand Voice & Tone

### Our Brand Voice

We express our brand every time we communicate with people, whether we're talking to them over the phone, sending them direct marketing, or interacting online. So, our overall personality must be reflected in our overall tone of voice.

### Voice

Alianza's voice is **confident, helpful, and approachable**. We understand small businesses because we are one. That means we relate to customers' challenges and passions and speak to them in a familiar, warm, and accessible way.

We are **clear**. We strive for helpful expertise. We speak like the experienced and compassionate business partner we wish we'd had way back when. Our goal is to fully understand the needs of the other person (customer, user, reader, listener) and to deliver delight, assurance, direction, or love, as appropriate.

### Tone

Voice is constant, but tone is fluid. Tone is the balance between serious information and voice. Choose a tone that meets the expectations of your intended audience based on empathy and context. What is their emotional state? What is the context of the communication?

### Writing Tips

#### Use active voice, not passive

The passive voice can make sentences awkward because it is vague about who is responsible for an action. The active voice makes your writing stronger, more direct, and more natural.

- ✅ **This:** We help service providers navigate the entire transformation process.
- ❌ **Not this:** Service providers are helped through the entire process.
- ✅ **This:** We have migrated hundreds of thousands of subscribers to our platform.
- ❌ **Not this:** Hundreds of thousands of subscribers have been migrated to our platform.

#### Talk to people, not at them

Communication is always most effective when the reader feels they are being addressed directly.

- ✅ **This:** Choose the partnership program that's right for you.
- ❌ **Not this:** Service providers can choose a partnership program that's right for them.

#### Use the Oxford comma

The Oxford (serial) comma appears near the end of a list before a conjunction. In some cases, leaving out this comma may change the meaning of a sentence. We use the Oxford comma for clarity and consistency.

- ✅ **This:** Waiting to move to a more modern cloud solution will cost customers, reduce market share, and limit your growth in the long run.
- ❌ **Not this:** Waiting to move to a more modern cloud solution will cost customers, reduce market share and limit your growth in the long run.

#### Use positive language

Choose words that are inspiring and encouraging, but realistic and attainable, like "progress," "opportunity," and "future." Use a more positive word when there is a choice, like "challenge" instead of "problem."

#### Be accessible

Remember, our customers are from a diverse range of backgrounds. Avoid excluding anybody and keep your writing accessible to everyone.

### Do This / Not That

| ✅ Do This | ❌ Not That |
|-----------|------------|
| Be approachable and accessible | Avoid jargon and unexplained acronyms |
| Write in the present tense | Don't be overly technical |
| Use active voice and present tense | Don't be too salesy or gimmicky |
| Use contractions | Don't use lots of words when fewer will do |
| Use exclamation marks sparingly | |
| Use simple and positive language | |
